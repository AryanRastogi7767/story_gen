    "murders itself, and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified\n",
    "limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds\n",
    "mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so\n",
    "dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish,\n",
    "proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the\n",
    "canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by’t. Out with’t! Within\n",

    "Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something\n",
    "that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me\n",
    "feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in\n",

    "Good Monsieur Charles. What’s the new news at the new court?\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES.\n",
    "There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news. That is, the old\n",
    "Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four\n",
    "loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose\n",
    "lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good\n",
    "leave to wander.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLIVER.\n",
    "Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banished with her\n",
    "father?\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES.\n",
    "O, no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever\n",
    "from their cradles bred together, that she would have followed her\n",
    "exile or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court and no less\n",
    "beloved of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies loved\n",
    "as they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLIVER.\n",
    "Where will the old Duke live?\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES.\n",
    "They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many merry men\n",
    "with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They\n",
    "say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time\n",
    "carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLIVER.\n",
    "What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES.\n",
    "Marry, do I, sir, and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given,\n",
    "sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a\n",
    "disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall. Tomorrow,\n",
    "sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some\n",
    "broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and\n",
    "tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for\n",
    "my own honour if he come in. Therefore, out of my love to you, I came\n",
    "hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his\n",
    "intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that\n",
    "it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\n",
    "\n",
    "OLIVER.\n",
    "Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will\n",
    "most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose\n",
    "herein, and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it;\n",
    "but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest\n",
    "young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every\n",
    "man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his\n",
    "natural brother. Therefore use thy discretion. I had as lief thou didst\n",
    "break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if thou\n",
    "dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on\n",
    "thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap thee by some\n",
    "treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by\n",
    "some indirect means or other. For I assure thee (and almost with tears\n",
    "I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day\n",
    "living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to\n",
    "thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and\n",
    "wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHARLES.\n",
    "I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow I’ll give\n",
    "him his payment. If ever he go alone again I’ll never wrestle for prize\n",

    "OLIVER.\n",
    "Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall\n",

    "than he. Yet he’s gentle, never schooled and yet learned, full of noble\n",
    "device, of all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much in the\n",
    "heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him,\n",
    "that I am altogether misprized. But it shall not be so long; this\n",

    "Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say:\n",
    "“This is no flattery. These are counsellors\n",
    "That feelingly persuade me what I am.”\n",
    "Sweet are the uses of adversity,\n",

    "DUKE SENIOR.\n",
    "Come, shall we go and kill us venison?\n",

    "Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out\n",
    "Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;\n",
    "To the which place a poor sequestered stag,\n",
    "That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,\n",
    "Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,\n",
    "The wretched animal heaved forth such groans\n",
    "That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat\n",
    "Almost to bursting, and the big round tears\n",
    "Coursed one another down his innocent nose\n",
    "In piteous chase. And thus the hairy fool,\n",

    "First, for his weeping into the needless stream:\n",
    "“Poor deer,” quoth he “thou mak’st a testament\n",
    "As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more\n",
    "To that which had too much.” Then, being there alone,\n",
    "Left and abandoned of his velvet friends:\n",
    "“’Tis right”; quoth he, “thus misery doth part\n",
    "The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,\n",
    "Full of the pasture, jumps along by him\n",
    "And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,\n",
    "“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens!\n",
    "’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look\n",
    "Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”\n",
    "Thus most invectively he pierceth through\n",
    "The body of the country, city, court,\n",
    "Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we\n",
    "Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,\n",
    "To fright the animals and to kill them up\n",

    "TOUCHSTONE.\n",
    "Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in\n",
    "respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught. In respect that it\n",
    "is solitary, I like it very well; but in respect that it is private, it\n",
    "is a very vile life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me\n",
    "well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a\n",
    "spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; but as there is no more\n",
    "plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in\n",
    "thee, shepherd?\n",
    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "No more but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is;\n",
    "and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good\n",
    "friends; that the property of rain is to wet, and fire to burn; that\n",
    "good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is\n",
    "lack of the sun; that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may\n",
    "complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.\n",
    "\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE.\n",
    "Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?\n",
    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "No, truly.\n",

    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "For not being at court? Your reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE.\n",
    "Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if\n",
    "thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and\n",
    "wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state,\n",
    "shepherd.\n",
    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as\n",
    "ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most\n",
    "mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you\n",

    "Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a\n",

    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "Besides, our hands are hard.\n",

    "\n",
    "CORIN.\n",
    "And they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep; and would\n",

    "\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE.\n",
    "Most shallow man! Thou worm’s meat in respect of a good piece of flesh\n",
    "indeed! Learn of the wise and perpend. Civet is of a baser birth than\n",

    "my lambs suck.\n",
    "\n",
    "TOUCHSTONE.\n",
    "That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams\n",
    "together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle;\n",
    "to be bawd to a bell-wether and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth\n",

    "ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe\n",
    "untied, and everything about you demonstrating a careless desolation.\n",

    "Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark\n",

    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Did you ever cure any so?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his\n",

    "being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing\n",

    "tears, full of smiles; for every passion something and for no passion\n",
    "truly anything, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this\n",
    "colour; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then\n",

    "was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook\n",
    "merely monastic. And thus I cured him, and this way will I take upon me\n",

    "\n",

    "SILVIUS.\n",
    "Sweet Phoebe, do not scorn me, do not, Phoebe.\n",
    "Say that you love me not, but say not so\n",
    "In bitterness. The common executioner,\n",
    "Whose heart th’ accustomed sight of death makes hard,\n",
    "Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck\n",
    "But first begs pardon. Will you sterner be\n",
    "Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?\n",

    "Enter Rosalind, Celia and Corin, at a distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHOEBE.\n",
    "I would not be thy executioner;\n",
    "I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.\n",
    "Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye.\n",
    "’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable\n",
    "That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,\n",
    "Who shut their coward gates on atomies,\n",
    "Should be called tyrants, butchers, murderers.\n",
    "Now I do frown on thee with all my heart,\n",
    "And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee.\n",
    "Now counterfeit to swoon; why, now fall down;\n",
    "Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,\n",
    "Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers.\n",
    "Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee.\n",
    "Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains\n",
    "Some scar of it; lean upon a rush,\n",
    "The cicatrice and capable impressure\n",
    "Thy palm some moment keeps. But now mine eyes,\n",
    "Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not;\n",
    "Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes\n",

    "O dear Phoebe,\n",
    "If ever—as that ever may be near—\n",

    "[_Advancing_.] And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,\n",
    "That you insult, exult, and all at once,\n",
    "Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty—\n",
    "As, by my faith, I see no more in you\n",
    "Than without candle may go dark to bed—\n",
    "Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?\n",
    "Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?\n",
    "I see no more in you than in the ordinary\n",
    "Of nature’s sale-work. ’Od’s my little life,\n",
    "I think she means to tangle my eyes too!\n",
    "No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it.\n",
    "’Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,\n",
    "Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,\n",
    "That can entame my spirits to your worship.\n",
    "You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,\n",
    "Like foggy south, puffing with wind and rain?\n",
    "You are a thousand times a properer man\n",
    "Than she a woman. ’Tis such fools as you\n",
    "That makes the world full of ill-favoured children.\n",
    "’Tis not her glass but you that flatters her,\n",
    "And out of you she sees herself more proper\n",

    "But, mistress, know yourself; down on your knees,\n",
    "And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love.\n",
    "For I must tell you friendly in your ear,\n",
    "Sell when you can; you are not for all markets.\n",
    "Cry the man mercy, love him, take his offer;\n",

    "For no ill will I bear you.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "I pray you do not fall in love with me,\n",
    "For I am falser than vows made in wine.\n",

    "Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.\n",
    "Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,\n",

    "I would have you.\n",

    "PHOEBE.\n",
    "Why, that were covetousness.\n",

    "But since that thou canst talk of love so well,\n",
    "Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,\n",

    "\n",
    "SILVIUS.\n",
    "So holy and so perfect is my love,\n",
    "And I in such a poverty of grace,\n",
    "That I shall think it a most plenteous crop\n",
    "To glean the broken ears after the man\n",
    "That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then\n",
    "A scattered smile, and that I’ll live upon.\n",

    "\n",
    "SILVIUS.\n",
    "Not very well, but I have met him oft,\n",
    "And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds\n",
    "That the old carlot once was master of.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHOEBE.\n",
    "Think not I love him, though I ask for him.\n",
    "’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well.\n",
    "But what care I for words? Yet words do well\n",
    "When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.\n",
    "It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—\n",
    "But sure he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him.\n",
    "He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him\n",
    "Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue\n",
    "Did make offence, his eye did heal it up.\n",
    "He is not very tall, yet for his years he’s tall;\n",
    "His leg is but so-so, and yet ’tis well.\n",
    "There was a pretty redness in his lip,\n",
    "A little riper and more lusty red\n",

    "Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.\n",
    "There be some women, Silvius, had they marked him\n",
    "In parcels as I did, would have gone near\n",
    "To fall in love with him; but for my part\n",
    "I love him not nor hate him not; and yet\n",
    "I have more cause to hate him than to love him.\n",
    "For what had he to do to chide at me?\n",
    "He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,\n",
    "And now I am remembered, scorned at me.\n",
    "I marvel why I answered not again.\n",
    "But that’s all one: omittance is no quittance.\n",
    "I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,\n",
    "And thou shalt bear it. Wilt thou, Silvius?\n",
    "\n",
    "SILVIUS.\n",
    "Phoebe, with all my heart.\n",

    "\n",
    "Enter Rosalind, Celia and Jaques.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "They say you are a melancholy fellow.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "I am so; I do love it better than laughing.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and\n",
    "betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Why then, ’tis good to be a post.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the\n",
    "musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud;\n",
    "nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is\n",
    "politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all\n",
    "these; but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,\n",
    "extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my\n",
    "travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous\n",
    "sadness.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you\n",
    "have sold your own lands to see other men’s. Then to have seen much and\n",
    "to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "Yes, I have gained my experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me\n",
    "merry than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Orlando.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!\n",
    "\n",
    "JAQUES.\n",
    "Nay, then, God be wi’ you, an you talk in blank verse.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Farewell, Monsieur Traveller. Look you lisp and wear strange suits;\n",
    "disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your\n",
    "nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are,\n",
    "or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola.\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Exit Jaques._]\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover!\n",
    "An you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Break an hour’s promise in love? He that will divide a minute into a\n",
    "thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute\n",
    "in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapped\n",
    "him o’ the shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Pardon me, dear Rosalind.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be\n",
    "wooed of a snail.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Of a snail?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Ay, of a snail, for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his\n",
    "head—a better jointure, I think, than you make a woman. Besides, he\n",
    "brings his destiny with him.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "What’s that?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives\n",
    "for. But he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his\n",
    "wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Virtue is no horn-maker and my Rosalind is virtuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "And I am your Rosalind.\n",
    "\n",
    "CELIA.\n",
    "It pleases him to call you so, but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer\n",
    "than you.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday humour, and like enough\n",
    "to consent. What would you say to me now, an I were your very, very\n",
    "Rosalind?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I would kiss before I spoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravelled for lack\n",
    "of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when\n",
    "they are out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking—God warn\n",
    "us—matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "How if the kiss be denied?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or I should think my\n",
    "honesty ranker than my wit.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "What, of my suit?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your\n",
    "Rosalind?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Then, in mine own person, I die.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years\n",
    "old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person,\n",
    "_videlicet_, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dashed out with a\n",
    "Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of\n",
    "the patterns of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair year\n",
    "though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer\n",
    "night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont\n",
    "and, being taken with the cramp, was drowned; and the foolish\n",
    "chroniclers of that age found it was Hero of Sestos. But these are all\n",
    "lies. Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them, but\n",
    "not for love.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her\n",
    "frown might kill me.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your\n",
    "Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition, and ask me what you will, I\n",
    "will grant it.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Then love me, Rosalind.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "And wilt thou have me?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Ay, and twenty such.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "What sayest thou?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Are you not good?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I hope so.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?—Come, sister, you\n",
    "shall be the priest and marry us.—Give me your hand, Orlando.—What do\n",
    "you say, sister?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Pray thee, marry us.\n",
    "\n",
    "CELIA.\n",
    "I cannot say the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "You must begin “Will you, Orlando—”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CELIA.\n",
    "Go to.—Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I will.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Ay, but when?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Why now, as fast as she can marry us.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "I might ask you for your commission. But I do take thee, Orlando, for\n",
    "my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a\n",
    "woman’s thought runs before her actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "So do all thoughts. They are winged.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "For ever and a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Say “a day” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when\n",
    "they woo, December when they wed. Maids are May when they are maids,\n",
    "but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee\n",
    "than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot\n",
    "against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires\n",
    "than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and\n",
    "I will do that when you are disposed to be merry. I will laugh like a\n",
    "hyena, and that when thou are inclined to sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "But will my Rosalind do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "By my life, she will do as I do.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "O, but she is wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Or else she could not have the wit to do this. The wiser, the\n",
    "waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the\n",
    "casement. Shut that, and ’twill out at the keyhole. Stop that, ’twill\n",
    "fly with the smoke out at the chimney.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither\n",
    "wilt?”\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Nay, you might keep that check for it till you met your wife’s wit\n",
    "going to your neighbour’s bed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "And what wit could wit have to excuse that?\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her\n",
    "without her answer unless you take her without her tongue. O, that\n",
    "woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never\n",
    "nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two o’clock I will be with thee\n",
    "again.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Ay, go your ways, go your ways. I knew what you would prove. My friends\n",
    "told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours\n",
    "won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so, come death! Two o’clock is your\n",
    "hour?\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "Ay, sweet Rosalind.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty\n",
    "oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise or\n",
    "come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical\n",
    "break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her\n",
    "you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the\n",
    "unfaithful. Therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORLANDO.\n",
    "With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind. So, adieu.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROSALIND.\n",
    "Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let\n",
    "time try. Adieu.\n",

    "This is called the “quip modest”. If again it was not well cut, he\n",
    "disabled my judgement. This is called the “reply churlish”. If again it\n",
    "was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is called the\n",

    "to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act established against\n",
    "the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and\n",

    "That in these several places of the city\n",

    "He’s a lamb indeed, that baas like a bear.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "And topping all others in boasting.\n",

    "\n",
    "BOTH TRIBUNES.\n",
    "Why, how are we censured?\n",
    "\n",
    "MENENIUS.\n",

    "BOTH TRIBUNES.\n",
    "Well, well, sir, well?\n",
    "\n",
    "MENENIUS.\n",
    "Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob\n",
    "you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins, and\n",
    "be angry at your pleasures, at the least, if you take it as a pleasure\n",

    "MENENIUS.\n",
    "I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else\n",
    "your actions would grow wondrous single. Your abilities are too\n",

    "MENENIUS.\n",

    "imperfect in favouring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon\n",
    "too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the\n",

    "cannot call you Lycurguses—if the drink you give me touch my palate\n",

    "major part of your syllables. And though I must be content to bear with\n",
    "those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\n",
    "tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm,\n",

    "Come, sir, come; we know you well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "MENENIUS.\n",
    "You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything. You are ambitious for\n",
    "poor knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in\n",
    "hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a faucet-seller, and then\n",
    "rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When\n",
    "you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be\n",
    "pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody\n",
    "flag against all patience, and, in roaring for a chamber pot, dismiss\n",
    "the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the\n",
    "peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You\n",
    "are a pair of strange ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "BRUTUS.\n",

    "MENENIUS.\n",
    "Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such\n",
    "ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose,\n",
    "it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not\n",
    "so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion or to be entombed\n",
    "in an ass’s packsaddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud, who,\n",
    "in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion,\n",
    "though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen.\n",
    "Good e’en to your Worships. More of your conversation would infect my\n",

    "MENENIUS.\n",
    "A letter for me? It gives me an estate of seven years’ health, in which\n",
    "time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign\n",

    "their estimation and report; but he hath so planted his honours in\n",
    "their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be\n",

    "one would set up a top.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND SERVINGMAN.\n",
    "Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in him. He had, sir, a\n",
    "kind of face, methought—I cannot tell how to term it.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST SERVINGMAN.\n",
    "He had so, looking as it were—Would I were hanged, but I thought there\n",
    "was more in him than I could think.\n",

    "SECOND SERVINGMAN.\n",
    "So did I, I’ll be sworn. He is simply the rarest man i’ th’ world.\n",

    "\n",
    "THIRD SERVINGMAN.\n",
    "Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars;\n",
    "set at upper end o’ th’ table; no question asked him by any of the\n",
    "senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a\n",
    "mistress of him, sanctifies himself with’s hand, and turns up the white\n",
    "o’ th’ eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general\n",
    "is cut i’ th’ middle and but one half of what he was yesterday, for the\n",

    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "None but the King?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,\n",

    "As, to seek through the regions of the earth\n",

    "And had, besides this gentleman in question,\n",
    "Two other sons, who, in the wars o’ th’ time,\n",
    "Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,\n",
    "Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow\n",
    "That he quit being; and his gentle lady,\n",
    "Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d\n",
    "As he was born. The King he takes the babe\n",
    "To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,\n",

    "cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make\n",
    "the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the\n",
    "author of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\n",
    "sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I\n",

    "Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting\n",

    "Larded with many several sorts of reasons,\n",
    "Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too,\n",
    "With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,\n",

    "Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—\n",
    "He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,\n",
    "Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes,\n",
    "Thrown out his angle for my proper life,\n",

    "It will be short. The interim is mine;\n",

    "HORATIO.\n",
    "No, my good lord.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath\n",
    "much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib\n",

    "to you from his Majesty.\n",
    "\n",

    "I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his\n",

    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.\n",

    "OSRIC.\n",

    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how.\n",
    "But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a\n",

    "\n",
    "[_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly\n",
    "come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most\n",
    "excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed,\n",
    "to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for\n",
    "you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to\n",
    "divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet\n",
    "but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of\n",
    "extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of\n",
    "such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable\n",
    "is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.\n",

    "breath?\n",
    "\n",

    "Sir?\n",
    "\n",

    "Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir,\n",
    "really.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "What imports the nomination of this gentleman?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Of Laertes?\n",
    "\n",
    "HORATIO.\n",
    "His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "Of him, sir.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "I know you are not ignorant,—\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much\n",
    "approve me. Well, sir?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence;\n",
    "but to know a man well were to know himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them\n",
    "in his meed he’s unfellowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "What’s his weapon?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Rapier and dagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "That’s two of his weapons. But well.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the\n",
    "which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards,\n",
    "with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages,\n",
    "in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most\n",
    "delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "What call you the carriages?\n",
    "\n",
    "HORATIO.\n",
    "I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "The carriages, sir, are the hangers.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon\n",
    "by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six\n",
    "Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three\n",
    "liberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish.\n",
    "Why is this all imponed, as you call it?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he\n",
    "shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And\n",
    "it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the\n",
    "answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "How if I answer no?\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the\n",
    "breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman\n",
    "willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if\n",
    "not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRIC.\n",
    "Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.\n",

    "This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many\n",
    "more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got\n",
    "the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty\n",
    "collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and\n",
    "winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are\n",
    "out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter a Lord.\n",
    "\n",
    "LORD.\n",
    "My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings\n",
    "back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your\n",
    "pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his\n",
    "fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able\n",
    "as now.\n",
    "\n",
    "LORD.\n",
    "The King and Queen and all are coming down.\n",

    "HORATIO.\n",
    "You will lose this wager, my lord.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual\n",
    "practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill\n",
    "all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "HORATIO.\n",
    "Nay, good my lord.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would\n",
    "perhaps trouble a woman.\n",
    "\n",
    "HORATIO.\n",
    "If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair\n",
    "hither, and say you are not fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAMLET.\n",
    "Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of\n",
    "a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it\n",
    "will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all.\n",
    "Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?\n",

    "This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,\n",
    "How I am punish’d with sore distraction.\n",
    "What I have done\n",
    "That might your nature, honour, and exception\n",
    "Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.\n",

    "Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Mortimer and Glendower.\n",
    "\n",
    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "These promises are fair, the parties sure,\n",
    "And our induction full of prosperous hope.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,\n",
    "Will you sit down? And uncle Worcester,\n",
    "A plague upon it! I have forgot the map.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "No, here it is.\n",
    "Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur;\n",
    "For by that name as oft as Lancaster doth speak of you\n",
    "His cheek looks pale, and with a rising sigh\n",
    "He wisheth you in heaven.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "And you in hell,\n",
    "As oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "I cannot blame him. At my nativity\n",
    "The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\n",
    "Of burning cressets, and at my birth\n",
    "The frame and huge foundation of the Earth\n",
    "Shaked like a coward.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Why, so it would have done\n",
    "At the same season, if your mother’s cat\n",
    "Had but kitten’d, though yourself had never been born.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "I say the Earth did shake when I was born.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "And I say the Earth was not of my mind,\n",
    "If you suppose as fearing you it shook.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "The heavens were all on fire, the Earth did tremble.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "O, then th’ Earth shook to see the heavens on fire,\n",
    "And not in fear of your nativity.\n",
    "Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth\n",
    "In strange eruptions; oft the teeming Earth\n",
    "Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d\n",
    "By the imprisoning of unruly wind\n",
    "Within her womb, which for enlargement striving,\n",
    "Shakes the old beldam Earth, and topples down\n",
    "Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth\n",
    "Our grandam Earth, having this distemp’rature,\n",
    "In passion shook.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Cousin, of many men\n",
    "I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave\n",
    "To tell you once again that at my birth\n",
    "The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\n",
    "The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds\n",
    "Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.\n",
    "These signs have mark’d me extraordinary,\n",
    "And all the courses of my life do show\n",
    "I am not in the roll of common men.\n",
    "Where is he living, clipp’d in with the sea\n",
    "That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,\n",
    "Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?\n",
    "And bring him out that is but woman’s son\n",

    "I think there is no man speaks better Welsh.\n",

    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "I can call spirits from the vasty deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Why, so can I, or so can any man,\n",
    "But will they come when you do call for them?\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil\n",
    "By telling truth; tell truth, and shame the devil.\n",
    "If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,\n",
    "And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.\n",
    "O, while you live, tell truth, and shame the devil!\n",
    "\n",
    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head\n",
    "Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye\n",
    "And sandy-bottom’d Severn have I sent him\n",
    "Bootless home and weather-beaten back.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Home without boots, and in foul weather too!\n",
    "How ’scapes he agues, in the devil’s name!\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Come, here’s the map, shall we divide our right\n",
    "According to our threefold order ta’en?\n",
    "\n",
    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "The archdeacon hath divided it\n",
    "Into three limits very equally:\n",
    "England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,\n",
    "By south and east is to my part assign’d:\n",
    "All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,\n",
    "And all the fertile land within that bound,\n",
    "To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you\n",
    "The remnant northward lying off from Trent.\n",
    "And our indentures tripartite are drawn,\n",
    "Which being sealed interchangeably,\n",
    "A business that this night may execute,\n",
    "Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I,\n",
    "And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth\n",
    "To meet your father and the Scottish power,\n",
    "As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.\n",
    "My father Glendower is not ready yet,\n",
    "Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.\n",
    "[_To Glendower._] Within that space you may have drawn together\n",
    "Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "A shorter time shall send me to you, lords,\n",
    "And in my conduct shall your ladies come,\n",
    "From whom you now must steal, and take no leave,\n",
    "For there will be a world of water shed\n",
    "Upon the parting of your wives and you.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,\n",
    "In quantity equals not one of yours.\n",
    "See how this river comes me cranking in,\n",
    "And cuts me from the best of all my land\n",
    "A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.\n",
    "I’ll have the current in this place dammed up,\n",
    "And here the smug and silver Trent shall run\n",
    "In a new channel, fair and evenly.\n",
    "It shall not wind with such a deep indent,\n",
    "To rob me of so rich a bottom here.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Not wind? It shall, it must. You see it doth.\n",
    "\n",
    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "Yea, but mark how he bears his course, and runs me up\n",
    "With like advantage on the other side,\n",
    "Gelding the opposed continent as much\n",
    "As on the other side it takes from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "WORCESTER.\n",
    "Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,\n",
    "And on this north side win this cape of land,\n",
    "And then he runs straight and even.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "I’ll have it so, a little charge will do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "I’ll not have it altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Will not you?\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "No, nor you shall not.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Who shall say me nay?\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Why, that will I.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "I can speak English, lord, as well as you,\n",
    "For I was train’d up in the English Court,\n",
    "Where being but young I framed to the harp\n",
    "Many an English ditty lovely well,\n",
    "And gave the tongue a helpful ornament—\n",
    "A virtue that was never seen in you.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart.\n",
    "I had rather be a kitten, and cry “mew”\n",
    "Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;\n",
    "I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn’d,\n",
    "Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree,\n",
    "And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,\n",
    "Nothing so much as mincing poetry.\n",
    "’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "Come, you shall have Trent turn’d.\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land\n",
    "To any well-deserving friend;\n",
    "But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,\n",
    "I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.\n",
    "Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?\n",
    "\n",
    "GLENDOWER.\n",
    "The moon shines fair, you may away by night.\n",
    "I’ll haste the writer, and withal\n",
    "Break with your wives of your departure hence.\n",
    "I am afraid my daughter will run mad,\n",
    "So much she doteth on her Mortimer.\n",

    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father!\n",
    "\n",
    "HOTSPUR.\n",
    "I cannot choose. Sometimes he angers me\n",
    "With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,\n",
    "Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,\n",
    "And of a dragon and a finless fish,\n",
    "A clip-wing’d griffin and a moulten raven,\n",
    "A couching lion and a ramping cat,\n",
    "And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff\n",
    "As puts me from my faith. I tell you what—\n",
    "He held me last night at least nine hours\n",
    "In reckoning up the several devils’ names\n",
    "That were his lackeys: I cried “Hum,” and “Well, go to,”\n",
    "But mark’d him not a word. O, he is as tedious\n",
    "As a tired horse, a railing wife,\n",
    "Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live\n",
    "With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,\n",
    "Than feed on cates and have him talk to me\n",
    "In any summer house in Christendom.\n",
    "\n",
    "MORTIMER.\n",
    "In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,\n",
    "Exceedingly well read, and profited\n",
    "In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,\n",
    "And wondrous affable, and as bountiful\n",
    "As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?\n",
    "He holds your temper in a high respect\n",
    "And curbs himself even of his natural scope\n",
    "When you come cross his humour, faith, he does.\n",
    "I warrant you that man is not alive\n",
    "Might so have tempted him as you have done\n",
    "Without the taste of danger and reproof:\n",
    "But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.\n",
    "\n",
    "WORCESTER.\n",
    "In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,\n",
    "And since your coming hither have done enough\n",
    "To put him quite besides his patience.\n",
    "You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.\n",
    "Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood—\n",
    "And that’s the dearest grace it renders you—\n",
    "Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,\n",
    "Defect of manners, want of government,\n",
    "Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain,\n",
    "The least of which haunting a nobleman\n",
    "Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain\n",
    "Upon the beauty of all parts besides,\n",
    "Beguiling them of commendation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Well, I am school’d. Good manners be your speed!\n",

    "And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,\n",
    "Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,\n",
    "Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep\n",
    "As is the difference betwixt day and night,\n",
    "The hour before the heavenly-harness’d team\n",

    "\n",
    "LORD BARDOLPH.\n",
    "My lord, I over-rode him on the way,\n",

    "Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?\n",
    "\n",
    "TRAVERS.\n",
    "My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back\n",
    "With joyful tidings, and, being better horsed,\n",
    "Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard\n",
    "A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,\n",
    "That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.\n",
    "He ask’d the way to Chester, and of him\n",
    "I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.\n",
    "He told me that rebellion had bad luck\n",
    "And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.\n",
    "With that he gave his able horse the head,\n",
    "And bending forward struck his armed heels\n",
    "Against the panting sides of his poor jade\n",
    "Up to the rowel-head, and starting so\n",
    "He seem’d in running to devour the way,\n",
    "Staying no longer question.\n",
    "\n",

    "Ha? Again:\n",
    "Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?\n",

    "\n",
    "LORD BARDOLPH.\n",
    "Who, he?\n",
    "He was some hilding fellow that had stolen\n",
    "The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,\n",
    "Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Morton.\n",
    "\n",
    "NORTHUMBERLAND.\n",
    "Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf,\n",

    "To fright our party.\n",
    "\n",
    "NORTHUMBERLAND.\n",
    "How doth my son and brother?\n",
    "Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek\n",
    "Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.\n",
    "Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,\n",
    "So dull, so dread in look, so woe-begone,\n",
    "Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,\n",
    "And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;\n",
    "But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,\n",
    "And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.\n",
    "This thou wouldst say: “Your son did thus and thus;\n",
    "Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas”\n",
    "Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:\n",
    "But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,\n",
    "Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,\n",
    "Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”\n",

    "You are too great to be by me gainsaid,\n",

    "Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.\n",
    "I see a strange confession in thine eye.\n",
    "Thou shakest thy head and hold’st it fear or sin\n",
    "To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so.\n",
    "The tongue offends not that reports his death;\n",
    "And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,\n",
    "Not he which says the dead is not alive.\n",
    "Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news\n",
    "Hath but a losing office, and his tongue\n",
    "Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,\n",
    "Remember’d tolling a departing friend.\n",

    "I am sorry I should force you to believe\n",

    "But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,\n",
    "Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreathed,\n",
    "To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down\n",
    "The never-daunted Percy to the earth,\n",
    "From whence with life he never more sprung up.\n",
    "In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire\n",
    "Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,\n",
    "Being bruited once, took fire and heat away\n",
    "From the best-temper’d courage in his troops;\n",
    "For from his metal was his party steel’d,\n",
    "Which once in him abated, all the rest\n",
    "Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.\n",
    "And as the thing that’s heavy in itself\n",
    "Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,\n",
    "So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,\n",
    "Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear\n",
    "That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim\n",
    "Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,\n",
    "Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester\n",
    "Too soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,\n",
    "The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword\n",
    "Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King,\n",
    "Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame\n",
    "Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight,\n",
    "Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all\n",
    "Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out\n",
    "A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,\n",
    "Under the conduct of young Lancaster\n",

    "You were advised his flesh was capable\n",
    "Of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit\n",
    "Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged.\n",
    "Yet did you say “Go forth;” and none of this,\n",
    "Though strongly apprehended, could restrain\n",

    "\n",
    "LORD BARDOLPH.\n",

    "My lord your son had only but the corpse,\n",

    "For that same word, “rebellion” did divide\n",

    "Seem’d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,\n",
    "This word, “rebellion,” it had froze them up,\n",
    "As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop\n",
    "Turns insurrection to religion.\n",

    "for a jewel,—the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet\n",
    "fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he\n",
    "shall get one off his cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face\n",
    "is a face-royal. God may finish it when He will, ’tis not a hair amiss\n",

    "brother to him, and I’ll be sworn he ne’er saw him but once in the\n",

    "never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth\n",
    "so over-cool their blood, and making many fish meals, that they fall\n",
    "into a kind of male green-sickness; and then, when they marry, they get\n",
    "wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should\n",
    "be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold\n",
    "operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the\n",

    "apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable\n",
    "shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the\n",

    "sherris is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled,\n",
    "left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and\n",
    "cowardice. But the sherris warms it and makes it course from the\n",
    "inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a\n",
    "beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to\n",
    "arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me\n",
    "all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this\n",
    "retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of sherris. So\n",
    "that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it\n",
    "a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack\n",
    "commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince\n",
    "Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his\n",
    "father he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land, manured, husbanded\n",
    "and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of\n",
    "fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a\n",

    "No; nor it is not meet he should. For though I speak it to you, I think\n",
    "the King is but a man as I am. The violet smells to him as it doth to\n",
    "me; the element shows to him as it doth to me; all his senses have but\n",
    "human conditions. His ceremonies laid by, in his nakedness he appears\n",
    "but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet,\n",
    "when they stoop, they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees\n",
    "reason of fears as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same\n",

    "WILLIAMS.\n",
    "That’s more than we know.\n",
    "\n",
    "BATES.\n",
    "Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know\n",
    "we are the King’s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the\n",
    "King wipes the crime of it out of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "WILLIAMS.\n",
    "But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning\n",
    "to make, when all those legs and arms and heads, chopp’d off in a\n",
    "battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, “We died at\n",
    "such a place”; some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon\n",
    "their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some\n",
    "upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that\n",
    "die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when\n",
    "blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be\n",
    "a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were\n",
    "against all proportion of subjection.\n",
    "\n",
    "KING HENRY.\n",
    "So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully\n",
    "miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule,\n",
    "should be imposed upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under\n",
    "his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assailed by\n",
    "robbers and die in many irreconcil’d iniquities, you may call the\n",
    "business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this\n",
    "is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of\n",
    "his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for\n",
    "they purpose not their death, when they purpose their services.\n",
    "Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come\n",
    "to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted\n",
    "soldiers. Some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and\n",
    "contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of\n",
    "perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored\n",
    "the gentle bosom of Peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men\n",
    "have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can\n",
    "outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle,\n",
    "war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish’d for before-breach\n",
    "of the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they feared the\n",
    "death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they\n",
    "perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of\n",
    "their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the\n",
    "which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the King’s; but\n",
    "every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the\n",
    "wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his\n",
    "conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the\n",
    "time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained; and in him\n",
    "that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an\n",

    "Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.\n",
    "Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?\n",
    "It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen;\n",
    "Unless the adage must be verified,\n",
    "That beggars mounted run their horse to death.\n",

    "And yet be seen to bear a woman’s face?\n",
    "Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;\n",

    "Bid’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:\n",
    "Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will;\n",
    "For raging wind blows up incessant showers,\n",

    "\n",
    "RICHARD.\n",
    "I cannot joy until I be resolved\n",
    "Where our right valiant father is become.\n",
    "I saw him in the battle range about,\n",
    "And watched him how he singled Clifford forth.\n",
    "Methought he bore him in the thickest troop\n",
    "As doth a lion in a herd of neat;\n",
    "Or as a bear, encompassed round with dogs,\n",
    "Who having pinched a few and made them cry,\n",

    "So fared our father with his enemies;\n",
    "So fled his enemies my warlike father.\n",
    "Methinks ’tis pride enough to be his son.\n",
    "See how the morning opes her golden gates\n",
    "And takes her farewell of the glorious sun.\n",

    "Trimmed like a younker prancing to his love!\n",

    "EDWARD.\n",
    "Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?\n",

    "RICHARD.\n",
    "Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;\n",
    "Not separated with the racking clouds,\n",
    "But severed in a pale clear-shining sky.\n",
    "See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,\n",
    "As if they vowed some league inviolable.\n",
    "Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.\n",
    "In this the heaven figures some event.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDWARD.\n",
    "’Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.\n",
    "I think it cites us, brother, to the field,\n",
    "That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,\n",
    "Each one already blazing by our meeds,\n",
    "Should notwithstanding join our lights together,\n",

    "And many strokes, though with a little axe,\n",
    "Hews down and fell the hardest-timbered oak.\n",
    "By many hands your father was subdued,\n",
    "But only slaughtered by the ireful arm\n",
    "Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen,\n",
    "Who crowned the gracious duke in high despite,\n",
    "Laughed in his face; and when with grief he wept,\n",
    "The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks\n",
    "A napkin steeped in the harmless blood\n",
    "Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.\n",
    "And after many scorns, many foul taunts,\n",
    "They took his head, and on the gates of York\n",
    "They set the same; and there it doth remain,\n",
    "The saddest spectacle that e’er I viewed.\n",

    "EDWARD.\n",
    "Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,\n",

    "O Clifford, boisterous Clifford, thou hast slain\n",
    "The flower of Europe for his chivalry;\n",
    "And treacherously hast thou vanquished him,\n",
    "For hand to hand he would have vanquished thee.\n",
    "Now my soul’s palace is become a prison.\n",
    "Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body\n",
    "Might in the ground be closed up in rest!\n",

    "RICHARD.\n",
    "I cannot weep, for all my body’s moisture\n",
    "Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;\n",
    "Nor can my tongue unload my heart’s great burthen,\n",
    "For selfsame wind that I should speak withal\n",
    "Is kindling coals that fires all my breast\n",
    "And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.\n",
    "To weep is to make less the depth of grief:\n",
    "Tears, then, for babes; blows and revenge for me!\n",

    "WARWICK.\n",
    "Ten days ago I drowned these news in tears,\n",

    "After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,\n",
    "Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,\n",
    "Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,\n",
    "Were brought me of your loss and his depart.\n",
    "I, then in London, keeper of the King,\n",
    "Mustered my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,\n",
    "And very well appointed, as I thought,\n",
    "Marched toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,\n",
    "Bearing the King in my behalf along;\n",
    "For by my scouts I was advertised\n",
    "That she was coming with a full intent\n",
    "To dash our late decree in Parliament\n",
    "Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.\n",
    "Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,\n",
    "Our battles joined, and both sides fiercely fought.\n",
    "But, whether ’twas the coldness of the King,\n",
    "Who looked full gently on his warlike Queen,\n",
    "That robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen,\n",
    "Or whether ’twas report of her success;\n",
    "Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigour,\n",
    "Who thunders to his captives blood and death,\n",
    "I cannot judge; but, to conclude with truth,\n",
    "Their weapons like to lightning came and went;\n",
    "Our soldiers’, like the night-owl’s lazy flight,\n",
    "Or like an idle thresher with a flail,\n",
    "Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.\n",
    "I cheered them up with justice of our cause,\n",
    "With promise of high pay and great rewards,\n",
    "But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,\n",
    "And we in them no hope to win the day;\n",
    "So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;\n",
    "Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,\n",
    "In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;\n",

    "WARWICK.\n",
    "Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers;\n",

    "With aid of soldiers to this needful war.\n",
    "\n",
    "RICHARD.\n",
    "’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled.\n",

    "But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.\n",
    "\n",
    "WARWICK.\n",
    "Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;\n",
    "For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine\n",
    "Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head\n",
    "And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,\n",

    "RICHARD.\n",
    "I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not.\n",

    "But in this troublous time what’s to be done?\n",
    "Shall we go throw away our coats of steel\n",

    "Attend me, lords. The proud insulting Queen,\n",
    "With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,\n",
    "And of their feather many moe proud birds,\n",
    "Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.\n",
    "He swore consent to your succession,\n",
    "His oath enrolled in the Parliament;\n",
    "And now to London all the crew are gone,\n",
    "To frustrate both his oath and what beside\n",
    "May make against the house of Lancaster.\n",
    "Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.\n",
    "Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,\n",
    "With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,\n",
    "Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,\n",
    "Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,\n",

    "No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.\n",

    "Like one that stands upon a promontory\n",
    "And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,\n",
    "Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,\n",

    "Why, Love forswore me in my mother’s womb,\n",

    "Like to a chaos, or an unlicked bear-whelp\n",
    "That carries no impression like the dam.\n",
    "And am I then a man to be beloved?\n",

    "And from that torment I will free myself,\n",
    "Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.\n",
    "Why, I can smile, and murder while I smile,\n",
    "And cry “Content!” to that which grieves my heart,\n",
    "And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,\n",
    "And frame my face to all occasions.\n",
    "I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,\n",
    "I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;\n",

    "SCENE I. Westminster. A street.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Whither away so fast?\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "O, God save ye.\n",
    "Even to the Hall, to hear what shall become\n",
    "Of the great Duke of Buckingham.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I’ll save you\n",
    "That labour, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony\n",
    "Of bringing back the prisoner.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Were you there?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Yes, indeed, was I.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Pray speak what has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "You may guess quickly what.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Is he found guilty?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Yes, truly is he, and condemned upon’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I am sorry for’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "So are a number more.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "But pray, how passed it?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I’ll tell you in a little. The great Duke\n",
    "Came to the bar, where to his accusations\n",
    "He pleaded still not guilty and alleged\n",
    "Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.\n",
    "The King’s attorney on the contrary\n",
    "Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions\n",
    "Of divers witnesses, which the Duke desired\n",
    "To have brought _viva voce_ to his face;\n",
    "At which appeared against him his surveyor,\n",
    "Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor, and John Car,\n",
    "Confessor to him, with that devil monk,\n",
    "Hopkins, that made this mischief.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "That was he\n",
    "That fed him with his prophecies?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "The same.\n",
    "All these accused him strongly, which he fain\n",
    "Would have flung from him, but, indeed he could not.\n",
    "And so his peers, upon this evidence,\n",
    "Have found him guilty of high treason. Much\n",
    "He spoke, and learnedly, for life, but all\n",
    "Was either pitied in him or forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "After all this, how did he bear himself?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "When he was brought again to th’ bar to hear\n",
    "His knell rung out, his judgement, he was stirred\n",
    "With such an agony, he sweat extremely\n",
    "And something spoke in choler, ill and hasty.\n",
    "But he fell to himself again, and sweetly\n",
    "In all the rest showed a most noble patience.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I do not think he fears death.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Sure he does not;\n",
    "He never was so womanish. The cause\n",
    "He may a little grieve at.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Certainly\n",
    "The Cardinal is the end of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "’Tis likely,\n",
    "By all conjectures: first, Kildare’s attainder,\n",
    "Then deputy of Ireland, who removed,\n",
    "Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,\n",
    "Lest he should help his father.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "That trick of state\n",
    "Was a deep envious one.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "At his return\n",
    "No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,\n",
    "And generally, whoever the King favours,\n",
    "The Cardinal instantly will find employment,\n",
    "And far enough from court too.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "All the commons\n",
    "Hate him perniciously and, o’ my conscience,\n",
    "Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much\n",
    "They love and dote on, call him bounteous Buckingham,\n",
    "The mirror of all courtesy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Buckingham from his arraignment. Tipstaves before him, the axe\n",
    "with the edge towards him, Halberds on each side, accompanied with Sir\n",
    "Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir William Sandys and common people.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Stay there, sir,\n",
    "And see the noble ruined man you speak of.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Let’s stand close and behold him.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUCKINGHAM.\n",
    "All good people,\n",
    "You that thus far have come to pity me,\n",
    "Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.\n",
    "I have this day received a traitor’s judgement,\n",
    "And by that name must die; yet heaven bear witness,\n",
    "And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,\n",
    "Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!\n",
    "The law I bear no malice for my death;\n",
    "’T has done, upon the premises, but justice.\n",
    "But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.\n",
    "Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em.\n",
    "Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,\n",
    "Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,\n",
    "For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.\n",
    "For further life in this world I ne’er hope,\n",
    "Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies\n",
    "More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me\n",
    "And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,\n",
    "His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave\n",
    "Is only bitter to him, only dying,\n",
    "Go with me like good angels to my end,\n",
    "And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,\n",
    "Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,\n",
    "And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, i’ God’s name.\n",
    "\n",
    "LOVELL.\n",
    "I do beseech your Grace, for charity,\n",
    "If ever any malice in your heart\n",
    "Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUCKINGHAM.\n",
    "Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you\n",
    "As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.\n",
    "There cannot be those numberless offences\n",
    "’Gainst me that I cannot take peace with. No black envy\n",
    "Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his Grace,\n",
    "And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him\n",
    "You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers\n",
    "Yet are the King’s and, till my soul forsake,\n",
    "Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live\n",
    "Longer than I have time to tell his years;\n",
    "Ever beloved and loving may his rule be;\n",
    "And when old Time shall lead him to his end,\n",
    "Goodness and he fill up one monument!\n",
    "\n",
    "LOVELL.\n",
    "To th’ waterside I must conduct your Grace,\n",
    "Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,\n",
    "Who undertakes you to your end.\n",
    "\n",
    "VAUX.\n",
    "Prepare there!\n",
    "The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready,\n",
    "And fit it with such furniture as suits\n",
    "The greatness of his person.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUCKINGHAM.\n",
    "Nay, Sir Nicholas,\n",
    "Let it alone. My state now will but mock me.\n",
    "When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable\n",
    "And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.\n",
    "Yet I am richer than my base accusers,\n",
    "That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it,\n",
    "And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.\n",
    "My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,\n",
    "Who first raised head against usurping Richard,\n",
    "Flying for succour to his servant Banister,\n",
    "Being distressed, was by that wretch betrayed,\n",
    "And, without trial, fell. God’s peace be with him.\n",
    "Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying\n",
    "My father’s loss, like a most royal prince,\n",
    "Restored me to my honours and out of ruins\n",
    "Made my name once more noble. Now his son,\n",
    "Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all\n",
    "That made me happy at one stroke has taken\n",
    "For ever from the world. I had my trial,\n",
    "And must needs say a noble one, which makes me\n",
    "A little happier than my wretched father.\n",
    "Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both\n",
    "Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most—\n",
    "A most unnatural and faithless service.\n",
    "Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,\n",
    "This from a dying man receive as certain:\n",
    "Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels\n",
    "Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends\n",
    "And give your hearts to, when they once perceive\n",
    "The least rub in your fortunes, fall away\n",
    "Like water from ye, never found again\n",
    "But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,\n",
    "Pray for me. I must now forsake ye. The last hour\n",
    "Of my long weary life is come upon me.\n",
    "Farewell. And when you would say something that is sad,\n",
    "Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me.\n",
    "\n",
    "[_Exeunt Duke and train._]\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "O, this is full of pity. Sir, it calls,\n",
    "I fear, too many curses on their heads\n",
    "That were the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "If the Duke be guiltless,\n",
    "’Tis full of woe. Yet I can give you inkling\n",
    "Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,\n",
    "Greater than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Good angels keep it from us!\n",
    "What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "This secret is so weighty, ’twill require\n",
    "A strong faith to conceal it.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Let me have it.\n",
    "I do not talk much.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I am confident;\n",
    "You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear\n",
    "A buzzing of a separation\n",
    "Between the King and Katherine?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Yes, but it held not;\n",
    "For when the King once heard it, out of anger\n",
    "He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight\n",
    "To stop the rumour and allay those tongues\n",
    "That durst disperse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "But that slander, sir,\n",
    "Is found a truth now, for it grows again\n",
    "Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain\n",
    "The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,\n",
    "Or some about him near, have, out of malice\n",
    "To the good Queen, possessed him with a scruple\n",
    "That will undo her. To confirm this too,\n",
    "Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately,\n",
    "As all think, for this business.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "’Tis the Cardinal;\n",
    "And merely to revenge him on the Emperor\n",
    "For not bestowing on him at his asking,\n",
    "The archbishopric of Toledo this is purposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I think you have hit the mark. But is’t not cruel\n",
    "That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal\n",
    "Will have his will, and she must fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "’Tis woeful.\n",
    "We are too open here to argue this.\n",

    "And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\n",
    "His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\n",
    "And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\n",
    "Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\n",
    "This many summers in a sea of glory,\n",
    "But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride\n",
    "At length broke under me and now has left me,\n",
    "Weary and old with service, to the mercy\n",
    "Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.\n",
    "Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!\n",
    "I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched\n",
    "Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favours!\n",
    "There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\n",
    "That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\n",

    "I know myself now, and I feel within me\n",
    "A peace above all earthly dignities,\n",
    "A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me,\n",

    "Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\n",
    "What news abroad?\n",
    "\n",
    "CROMWELL.\n",
    "The heaviest and the worst\n",

    "That’s somewhat sudden.\n",
    "But he’s a learned man. May he continue\n",
    "Long in his Highness’ favour, and do justice\n",
    "For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,\n",

    "The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.\n",

    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "’Tis very true. But that time offered sorrow,\n",
    "This, general joy.\n",
    "\n",

    "The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "That I can tell you too. The Archbishop\n",
    "Of Canterbury, accompanied with other\n",
    "Learned and reverend fathers of his order,\n",
    "Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off\n",
    "From Ampthill where the Princess lay; to which\n",

    "And, to be short, for not appearance and\n",
    "The King’s late scruple, by the main assent\n",

    "Marquess Dorset,\n",

    "\n",
    "God save you, sir. Where have you been broiling?\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Among the crowds i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger\n",
    "Could not be wedged in more. I am stifled\n",
    "With the mere rankness of their joy.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "You saw\n",
    "The ceremony?\n",
    "\n",

    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Good sir, speak it to us.\n",

    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "As well as I am able. The rich stream\n",
    "Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen\n",
    "To a prepared place in the choir, fell off\n",
    "A distance from her, while her Grace sat down\n",
    "To rest a while, some half an hour or so,\n",
    "In a rich chair of state, opposing freely\n",
    "The beauty of her person to the people.\n",
    "Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman\n",
    "That ever lay by man, which when the people\n",
    "Had the full view of, such a noise arose\n",
    "As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,\n",
    "As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks,\n",
    "Doublets, I think, flew up, and had their faces\n",
    "Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy\n",
    "I never saw before. Great-bellied women\n",
    "That had not half a week to go, like rams\n",
    "In the old time of war, would shake the press\n",
    "And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living\n",
    "Could say “This is my wife” there, all were woven\n",
    "So strangely in one piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "But what followed?\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces\n",
    "Came to the altar, where she kneeled and saintlike\n",
    "Cast her fair eyes to heaven and prayed devoutly;\n",
    "Then rose again and bowed her to the people,\n",
    "When by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n",
    "She had all the royal makings of a queen,\n",
    "As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,\n",
    "The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems\n",
    "Laid nobly on her; which performed, the choir,\n",
    "With all the choicest music of the kingdom,\n",
    "Together sung _Te Deum_. So she parted,\n",
    "And with the same full state paced back again\n",
    "To York Place, where the feast is held.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIRST GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Sir,\n",
    "You must no more call it “York Place”, that’s past;\n",
    "For since the Cardinal fell, that title’s lost.\n",
    "’Tis now the King’s, and called “Whitehall”.\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "I know it,\n",
    "But ’tis so lately altered that the old name\n",
    "Is fresh about me.\n",
    "\n",
    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "What two reverend bishops\n",
    "Were those that went on each side of the Queen?\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Stokesley and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,\n",

    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",

    "Who may that be, I pray you?\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Thomas Cromwell,\n",
    "A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly\n",

    "SECOND GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "He will deserve more.\n",
    "\n",
    "THIRD GENTLEMAN.\n",
    "Yes, without all doubt.\n",
    "Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way,\n",
    "Which is to th’ court, and there ye shall be my guests,\n",
    "Something I can command. As I walk thither,\n",
    "I’ll tell ye more.\n",

    "\n",
    "[_She sits._]\n",

    "So. Now, methinks, I feel a little ease.\n",
    "Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou ledst me,\n",

    "Was dead?\n",
    "\n",
    "GRIFFITH.\n",
    "Yes, madam, but I think your Grace,\n",

    "Well, the voice goes, madam.\n",
    "For after the stout Earl Northumberland\n",
    "Arrested him at York and brought him forward,\n",
    "As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,\n",
    "He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill\n",
    "He could not sit his mule.\n",

    "Alas, poor man!\n",
    "\n",
    "GRIFFITH.\n",
    "At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,\n",
    "Lodged in the abbey, where the reverend abbot,\n",
    "With all his covent, honourably received him;\n",
    "To whom he gave these words: “O father abbot,\n",
    "An old man, broken with the storms of state,\n",
    "Is come to lay his weary bones among ye.\n",
    "Give him a little earth for charity.”\n",
    "So went to bed, where eagerly his sickness\n",
    "Pursued him still; and three nights after this,\n",
    "About the hour of eight, which he himself\n",
    "Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,\n",
    "Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,\n",
    "He gave his honours to the world again,\n",
    "His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.\n",
    "\n",
    "QUEEN KATHERINE.\n",
    "So may he rest. His faults lie gently on him!\n",
    "Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,\n",
    "And yet with charity. He was a man\n",
    "Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking\n",
    "Himself with princes; one that by suggestion\n",
    "Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair-play.\n",
    "His own opinion was his law. I’ th’ presence\n",
    "He would say untruths, and be ever double\n",
    "Both in his words and meaning. He was never,\n",
    "But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.\n",
    "His promises were, as he then was, mighty;\n",
    "But his performance, as he is now, nothing.\n",

    "\n",
    "GRIFFITH.\n",
    "This Cardinal,\n",
    "Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly\n",
    "Was fashioned to much honour. From his cradle\n",
    "He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one,\n",
    "Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading;\n",
    "Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,\n",
    "But to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.\n",
    "And though he were unsatisfied in getting,\n",
    "Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,\n",
    "He was most princely. Ever witness for him\n",
    "Those twins of learning that he raised in you,\n",
    "Ipswich and Oxford, one of which fell with him,\n",
    "Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;\n",
    "The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,\n",
    "So excellent in art, and still so rising,\n",
    "That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.\n",

    "times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged against me.\n",
    "He stands there, like a mortar-piece, to blow us. There was a\n",
    "haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him that railed upon me till her\n",
    "pinked porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in\n",
    "the state. I missed the meteor once and hit that woman, who cried out\n",

    "succour, which were the hope o’ th’ Strand, where she was quartered.\n",
    "They fell on; I made good my place; at length they came to th’\n",

    "behind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles that I was\n",

    "’Tis too respective and too sociable\n",
    "For your conversion. Now your traveller,\n",
    "He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess,\n",
    "And when my knightly stomach is suffic’d,\n",
    "Why then I suck my teeth and catechize\n",
    "My picked man of countries: “My dear sir,”\n",
    "Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin,\n",
    "“I shall beseech you”—that is Question now;\n",
    "And then comes Answer like an absey book:\n",
    "“O sir,” says Answer “at your best command;\n",
    "At your employment; at your service, sir.”\n",
    "“No, sir,” says Question, “I, sweet sir, at yours.”\n",
    "And so, ere Answer knows what Question would,\n",
    "Saving in dialogue of compliment,\n",
    "And talking of the Alps and Apennines,\n",
    "The Pyrenean and the river Po,\n",
    "It draws toward supper in conclusion so.\n",
    "But this is worshipful society,\n",
    "And fits the mounting spirit like myself;\n",
    "For he is but a bastard to the time\n",
    "That doth not smack of observation,\n",
    "And so am I, whether I smack or no;\n",
    "And not alone in habit and device,\n",
    "Exterior form, outward accoutrement,\n",
    "But from the inward motion to deliver\n",
    "Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,\n",
    "Which, though I will not practise to deceive,\n",
    "Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;\n",
    "For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.\n",
    "But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?\n",
    "What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband\n",

    "Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess—\n",
    "Could … get me. Sir Robert could not do it.\n",

    "BASTARD.\n",
    "Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.\n",
    "What! I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder.\n",
    "But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son.\n",
    "I have disclaim’d Sir Robert and my land;\n",
    "Legitimation, name, and all is gone.\n",
    "Then, good my mother, let me know my father—\n",
    "Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?\n",

    "LADY FAULCONBRIDGE.\n",
